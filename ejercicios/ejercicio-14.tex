(a) Express  \( \int_0^1 \int_0^{x^2} xy \, dy \,dx \) as an integral over the triangle \( D^* \), which is the set of \( (u, v) \) where
\( 0 \leq u \leq 1 \) , \( 0 \leq v \leq u \). (HINT: Find a one-to-one mapping \( T \) of \( D^* \) onto the given region of integration.)
(b) Evaluate this integral directly and as an integral over \( D^* \)
