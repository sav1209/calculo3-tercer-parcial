Let $D^*$ be a $v-$simple region in the $uv$ plane bounded by $v = g(u)$ and $v = h(u) \leq g(u)$ for $a \leq u \leq b.$ Let $T:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ be the transformation given by $x = u$ and $y = \psi (u, v)$ where $\psi$ is of class $C^{-1}$ and $\partial \psi / \partial v$ is never zero. Assume that $T(D^*) = D$ is a $y-$simple region; show that if $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, then

$$\iint_D f(x y) \ dx \ dy = \iint_{D^*} f(u, \psi(u, v)) \begin{vmatrix}
    \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial v}
\end{vmatrix} \ dudv$$
