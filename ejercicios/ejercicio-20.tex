Let \( T : \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3 \) be defined by
\[
T(u, v, w) = \big(u \cos v \cos w, \, u \sin v \cos w, \, u \sin w\big).
\]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]  Show that \( T \) T is onto the unit sphere; that is, every \( (x, y, z) \) with \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 \) can be written as \( (x, y, z) = T(u, v, w) \) for some \( (u, v, w) \).
    \item[(b)]  Show that \( T \) is not one-to-one.
\end{enumerate}
